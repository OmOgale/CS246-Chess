<p>
  This project was designed after multiple planning revisions as well as whiteboard brainstorming using UML Diagrams. Created in <code>C++</code> utilizing <b>OOP principles</b>, software design practices such as <b>MVC</b> as well as algorithms for opponent AI such as <b>Minimax</b> with Alpha-Beta pruning.

<div>
  <p>
      This project involves the implementation of a Text Display as well as a Graphical bitmap Display using <code>XWindow</code>. The game is a classic 8X8 chessboard which can be played by human as well as AI opponents. There is a setup mode implemented so that a user can setup custom puzzles for training. Multiple       enhancements were also considered and implemented such:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Undo</b> feature which allows users to revert upto the start of the game. </li>
    <li>An additional <b>level</b> that searches upto an analysis depth of <b>5 moves</b> by utilizing Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning.</li>
    <li>A <b>hints</b> feature which guides a player to choosing the most optimal move.</li>
    <li>Cohesive checks have also been implemented to detect edge-cases such as preventing a player move that could lead to a "Discovered Check".</li>
    <li>We also accounted for moves such as <b>en-passant</b> and <b>castling</b> which we have incorporated so that the AI can use such special moves fruitfully too.</li>
  </ul>
